# Machine Learning Repository

Welcome to the Machine Learning repository! üöÄ These files are based on my academic essays and each one (one per branch) describes another topic.

This repository is dedicated to exploring various Machine Learning techniques using Python. While it's not created entirely from scratch like some of our previous repositories, it leverages knowledge gained from our endeavors in Classification Techniques, Techniques of Multidimensional Statistical Analysis, Computational Intelligence, and Neural Networks. üß†

## Repository Focus

- **Building on Prior Knowledge**: This repository complements our previous work and serves as a bridge to apply and expand upon the concepts explored in these repositories:
    - [TSP Problem from scratch with different metaheuristic](https://github.com/kottoization/TSP-from-scratch-in-Python)
    - [PSFP Problem from scratch with different metaheuristics](https://github.com/kottoization/PFSP-from-scratch-in-Python)
    - [Classification Techniques](https://github.com/kottoization/classification-techniques)
    - [Techniques of Multidimensional Statistical Analysis](https://github.com/kottoization/-techniques-of-multidimensional-statistical-analysis)
    - [Neural Networks from scratch](https://github.com/username/neural-networks-repo) 

## Branch Structure

- **Diverse ML Techniques**: Different branches within this repository host various ML techniques. Explore these branches to gain insights into distinct ML methodologies and implementations. üåê Labs 3-6 are in polish for now, that's gonna be changed in the near future and also reports with conclusions and brother descriptions will be added.
